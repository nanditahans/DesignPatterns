"avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving multiple objects a chance to handle the request".
 For example, an ATM uses the Chain of Responsibility design pattern in money giving process.

 we can say that normally each receiver contains reference of another receiver.
 If one object cannot handle the request then it passes the same to the next receiver and so on.
