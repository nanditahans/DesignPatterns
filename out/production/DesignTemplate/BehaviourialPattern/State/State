 State design pattern is used when an Object changes its behavior based on its internal state.

If we have to change behavior of an object based on its state,
we can have a state variable in the Object and use if-else condition block to perform
different actions based on the state.
State pattern is used to provide a systematic and lose-coupled way to achieve this
through Context and State implementations.
